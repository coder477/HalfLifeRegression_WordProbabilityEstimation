# WordProbability Estimation
This is a representation of HalfLife Regression algorithm used to estimate the probability that a user reminds a word after learning it.

This is based on duolingo's working algorithm mention in the paper below.

### Concepts 

Overfitting

Gradient descent 

Gradient descent algorithms (Adagrad may not be the best solution, depending on the data) 

Cross validation, tuning 

Maximum Likelihood Estimation 

Introduction to theano (theano might be useful because gradients need not be calculated manually. Also, a lot of gradient descent algorithms can be implemented on the fly. Has a bit of a learning curve) 

theano documentation 

keras (uses theano as a backend. Useful for implementing neural networks easily)
